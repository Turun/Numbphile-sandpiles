# Numbphile-sandpiles
playing around with "sandpiles". small simulation program for the infinite plane.
optimized it now (a bit):

same window for choosing size, sand and box size. works fine.

while calculating now createsa small window that shows height, width, size and sand of what is currently caluculated. also keeps the number of iterations updated. 

the actual finished grid is displayed using a buffered image. on it's side all data is shown again. you can svae the image. images with more than 1 000 000 sand are automatically saved. you can also manually save smaller pictures. with the back button you get back to where you can choose height, width, size and sand of your next image you want to calculate.
